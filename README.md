# Weather Dashboard: Don't Get Caught Raining on Your Parade (or Code)
This project is your knight in shining armor (or should we say, sunshine?) against the unpredictable weather gods. It's a weather data collection system built with the following:

- Python: Because who wants to wrestle with a dragon of a programming language when you can slay weather data with a friendly Python script?
OpenWeather API: Our trusty weather oracle, providing real-time data for multiple cities (just don't ask it to predict your boss's mood).
- AWS S3 Bucket: A secure digital fortress for your weather data, so you don't have to worry about rogue squirrels chewing through your weather reports (it's happened, trust us).

## Here's What This Project Can Do:
- Fetch weather data in real-time: No more frantically refreshing weather apps – get the latest scoop on temperature, humidity, and conditions.
- Track multiple cities: Because who doesn't love a little global weather voyeurism? (Just don't stalk any weather patterns, that's creepy.)
- Store data in an AWS S3 Bucket: Keep your weather data safe and sound, even if your computer decides to take a tropical vacation (hopefully with a return ticket).
- Timestamp everything: Because even weather data deserves a little historical context. You never know, maybe you can predict the next thunderstorm based on last year's squirrel migration patterns (we're not making promises here).
- Project Structure: Not a Mess, Just Organized Chaos

## How to Get Started (Without Getting Lost in the Weather Report):

### Clone the Repository:

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-dashboard.git```

### Install Dependencies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the project root directory and fill it with your API key and AWS credentials. Remember, never commit this file to version control (think of it like keeping your secret handshake a secret).

```
    OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
    AWS_REGION=your_aws_region  # (Optional: Specify your AWS region if needed)

```

### Configure AWS Credentials (Optional):
If you haven't set up AWS credentials yet, you might need to create an IAM user with S3 access permissions. Don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds (unless you're afraid of virtual clouds, in which case, we understand).

### Run the Application:

```python src/weather_dashboard.py```

And voila! You're now a weather data maestro, conducting the symphony of real-time weather information.

### What You Learnt:
- How to wrangle weather data like a champion – no bullwhips required!
- The art of securely storing your data, so even curious squirrels can't peek.
- Python best practices – because even weather data deserves a little elegance.
- Version control with Git – so you can track your code changes and never lose a precious weather report (unless, of course, Mother Nature decides to delete it herself).

## Bonus Tip: If your code throws an error, don't despair. Remember, even the most experienced weather forecasters sometimes get it wrong. Just debug with patience and a good sense of humor (and maybe a cup of coffee).
